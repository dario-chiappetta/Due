Corpora
=======

Machine Learning models are trained on datasets. Natural Language Processing
datasets are called **corpora**, and are precious resources to train your agents.

Due offers an interface to a number of corpora, that are returned in the
standard format of a list of :class:`due.Episode` (making assumptions when necessary).
