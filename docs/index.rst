Welcome to Due's documentation!
===============================

Due is an autonomous **conversational agent** built with three goals in mind:

* Learning oriented: the more you talk, the better it gets
* Action capable: user-defined actions (shell scripts) are natural components of the conversation
* Modular architecture: different Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models can be and integrated in the agents

Due is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/dario-chiappetta/Due) and it's maintained by Dario Chiappetta (dario dot chi at inventati dot org).

**NOTE** Due is in early development stage, and currently is not likely to be of any use to you. You are still welcome to give it a try and get in touch for contributions or suggestions!
