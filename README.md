# DUE - A learning digital assistant

Due is a digital assistant built with these goals in mind:

* Learning oriented: the more you talk, the better it gets
* Action capable: user-defined actions (shell scripts) are natural components of the conversation
* Modular architecture: the brain module complies to an interface, to allow replacement with better ones.
