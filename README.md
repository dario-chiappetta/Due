# DUE - A learning digital assistant

Due is an autonomous conversational agent built with these goals in mind:

* Learning oriented: the more you talk, the better it gets
* Action capable: user-defined actions (shell scripts) are natural components of the conversation
* Modular architecture: different brain models can be and integrated in the agents

## Work in progress!
Thanks for stopping by, but be patient: I just started the project, and it will take a while before the magic happens... Meanwhile, feel free to get in touch at dario DOT chi AT inventati DOT org
